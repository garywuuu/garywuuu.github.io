I'm a Senior at Harvard pursuing a concurrent bachelor's and master's degree in Computer Science. 

This past year I co-founded an LLMOps startup building custom LLM Evals and raised from Pear VC and Unusual Ventures. I spent the summer as an Associate Product Manager Intern at Salesforce building API's to enable new Multi-Modal AI workflows & agents on Agentforce. 

Earlier, I was at Signum Capital doing Technical Crypto Research and interned at Teradata and Alpaca Markets, working on LLMOps and Algorithmic Trading respectively.

Outside of school I play tennis, eat spicy Sichuan food, and watch sci-fi movies.
