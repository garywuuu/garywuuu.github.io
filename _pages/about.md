I'm a Senior at Harvard pursuing a concurrent bachelor's and master's degree in Computer Science. This past year I co-founded a stealth LLMOps startup (raised from Pear VC and Unusual Ventures) and was an Associate Product Manager Intern at Salesforce working on Multi-Modal Workflows & Agents. Previously, I was at Signum Capital doing Technical Crypto Research and interned at Teradata and Alpaca Markets, working on LLMOps and Algorithmic Trading respectively. 

Outside of school, I love playing tennis, eating spicy food, and watching sci-fi movies.
