I'm a Senior at Harvard pursuing a concurrent bachelor's and master's degree in Computer Science. This past year I co-founded a stealth LLMOps startup (raised from Pear VC and Unusual Ventures) and was an Associate Product Manager Intern at Salesforce working on Multi-Modal Workflows & Agents. Previously, I was at Signum Capital doing Technical Crypto Research and interned at Teradata and Alpaca Markets, working on LLMOps and Algorithmic Trading respectively. 

Outside of school, I'm an avid tennis player, foodie, and sci-fi movie enjoyer.
